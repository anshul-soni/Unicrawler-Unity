# Unicrawler-Unity

This is a unity project I did during my bachelors around 2013, I did this just for fun. 
Its a very simple game, where a player controls a space ship which has three types of bullets, for 3 different types of enemies.
The game uses 
WASD to move the space ship, and uses key Num Key 1, 2, 3 to shoot. 

The game supports touch controls when deployed to android, windows or blackberry device.
The game is mobile ready, so can directly be deployed to any of the avaiable devices.
